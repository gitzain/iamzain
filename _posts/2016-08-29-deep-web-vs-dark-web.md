# Deep Web vs Dark Web

![https://iamzain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/deep-web-illustration-868x651.png](https://iamzain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/deep-web-illustration-868x651.png)

Did you know only a small percentage of the internet is easily accessible via major search engines i.e. indexed by Google etc. The parts of the internet that are not accessible via major search engines are called the Deep Web or the Dark Web; so whats the difference between these or are they the same?

## **Deep Web**

The deep web are pages that are not indexed by major search engines; this maybe for a whole bunch of reasons including:

- The website owner doesn’t know how to get the page indexed.
- Some sites are protected i.e. you need a password to access.
- The website owner has specifically instructed Google not to index their website

## **Dark Web**

Very simply put the dark web is comprised of websites that are only accessible by installing special software such as [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) or [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/).

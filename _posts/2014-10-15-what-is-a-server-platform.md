In previous posts such as [Linux vs Unix](http://www.iamzain.com/blog/linux-vs-unix) and [Types of computer architecture (part 1)](http://www.iamzain.com/blog/types-of-computer-architecture) we’ve looked at operating systems and types of computer architecture. If you haven’t read these previous posts you may want to.

A platform in technology is the underlying OS + Hardware combination that application/s can run on. Bellow are some examples:

Windows Server on x86-64 Hardware

Solaris on SPARC Hardware

Red Hat Enterprise Linux on x86-64 Hardware

z/OS on z/Architecture Hardware

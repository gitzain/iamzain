We looked at different data stores in the [Types of Data Store](http://www.iamzain.com/blog/types-of-data-store) post. Different data stores are suited to different use cases. This post focuses on one type of data store called a database. A database is way of storing data in an organised way to make it easy to access.

There are actually different types of databases. We’re not just talking about different bits of database software such as Oracle Database or Microsoft SQL Server. So what do we mean by different types? Databases can be classified into different types based on how they organise, store and retrieve data. Below are the main types of database:

1. Relational
2. NoSQL
3. Data Warehouse

Stay tuned for further posts that will dive deeper into each one of these types.

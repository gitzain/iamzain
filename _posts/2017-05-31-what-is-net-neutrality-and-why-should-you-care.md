# What is Net Neutrality and why should you care?!

When government and large corporations want us to ignore an issue that will benefit them and be to our detriment they make the issue as hard to understand as possible. For example, look at politics, often very important issues are being decided but by making politics difficult to understand and engage in, it leaves Government pretty much out on their own to do what they wish.

Net Neutrality is another one of these issues which is being made complex to ensure we don’t engage thus leaving large corporations to do as they please ultimately for their own monetary benefit. Net neutrality is the principal that the internet should treat all traffic equally by your internet service provider (ISP) and governments regulating the Internet. So your ISP should not slow down or block certain websites or services based on who pays them the most or to favour their own services.

So next time someone asks about your opinion on net neutrality, now you know. And hopefully your response will be “I agree with net neutrality and am in favour of it. I want an internet where all websites and services, and access to those websites and services are treated equally!”

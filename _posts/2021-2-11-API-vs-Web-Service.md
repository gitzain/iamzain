## **What is an API?**

API stands for application programming interface. An API is a mechanism by which allow you to write code that allows interaction with another program or application.

For example Microsoft Word has an API (visual basic) that allows anyone to write a program to interact with Word.

An API can be in any programming language. To interact with that API your program or application needs to be the same language.

## **Web Service**

A web service is a program written to perform a specific function or set of functions for another program over a network (i.e. internet).

For example if we were writing some Skiing application and needed weather data we could call the [Yahoo Weather Web Service](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) that returns the data we need.

Advantage of a web service is that the way to interact with the web service it is always the same (a HTTP call) and the response is always in a format that any programming language can consume.

A web service is considered a special kind of API.
